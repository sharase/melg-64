(29 March 2021)
We made index.html insted of README.md.

(28 March 2021)
We wrote README.md.
The directories were edited.
We equipped with a jump function as standard feature.

(24 March 2021)
Typos in the initialization scheme were fixed.
The output functions
	genrand64_fast_res52()
	genrand64_fast_res52_open()
	genrand64_res53()
were modified.
Thus, please note that output velues were changed.

(5 September 2018)
The paper has been published.

(27 March 2017)
The paper was revised.
We renamed the proposed generators.
We attached the acronym 64-bit MELGs, 
for 64-bit ``Maximally Equidistributed $\mathbb{F}_2$-Linear Generators", 
to the proposed generators.

We modified an initialization scheme in init_by_array64.
Thus, the output values have been changed.

(12 May 2016)
Minor changes: unsigned long long int -> unsigned long long
               void memt_jump(void); //jump ahead by 2^256 steps

(10 May 2016)
We implemented the following functions:
  genrand64_res53()
  genrand64_res53_open()
to generate double-precision floating point numbers on [0,1)- and (0,1)-real-interval by using union tricks.

We implemented a jump ahead algorithm for parallel computing. 
The default skip size is 2^256.

We also changed some examples in the main functions.

(24 May 2015)
The code in C was released.
