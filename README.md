# Implementing 64-bit Maximally Equidistributed  $\mathbb{F}_2$-Linear Generators with Mersenne Prime Period

## What is MELG-64?

The 64-bit **M**aximally **E**quidistributed $\mathbb{F}_2$-**L**inear **G**enerators with Mersenne Prime Period (**MELG-64**) are 64-bit Mersenne-Twister-type pseudorandom number generators developed between 2014 and 2017, and the corresponding paper was published on ACM TOMS in 2018.

## Background
CPUs and operating systems are moving from 32 to 64 bits, and hence it is important to have good 64-bit pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) designed to fully exploit these word lengths. 

The 32-bit Mersenne Twister (MT) MT19937 (Matsumoto--Nishimura, 1998) is one of the most widely used PRNGs, but it is _not completely optimized_ in terms of _high-dimensional uniformity_, which is a theoretical criterion of PRNGs. The 32-bit WELL generators (Panneton et. al., 2006) was developed in order to overcome this weakness. 

However, for 64-bit PRNGs, MT19937-64 (Nishimura, 2000) and SFMT19937 using SIMD (Saito and Matsumoto, 2008), etc., have been proposed, but there exists no 64-bit MT-type long-period linear PRNG completely optimized for high-dimensional uniformity, such as a variant of WELL generators.

In this page, we introduce 64-bit maximally equidistributed $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear PRNGs (**MELG-64**) that are optimal in this respect and have speeds equivalent to 64-bit Mersenne Twisters. 

## Feature

MELG19937-64 has the following properties:
-  Very long period $2^{19937}-1$ $\approx 10^{6000}$;
- High-dimensional uniformity completely optimized;
- Fast generation competitive with MT19937-64;
- Memory size requiring only 312 words (similarly to MT19937-64).

We provide the codes for **MELG-64** with various period lengths from $2^{607}-1$ to $2^{44497}-1$. Also, we have implemented the jump-ahead algorithm in order to obtain disjoint streams in parallel computing.

## Usage

Please click the "Code" button in the upper right of the content pane, and clone this page:

or download the zip file. If you want to use **MELG19937-64**, 
> cd melg-64 </br>

Before using, please initialize the state by the function init_by_array64(init, length) in a similar way as Mersenne Twisters.

## High-dimensional uniformity
The high-dimensional uniformity is a theoretical criterion for PRNGs, which is assessed via the _dimension of equidistribution with $v$-bit accuracy_ as follows:

Let

$$ \mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_{P-1}, \mathbf{x}_P = \textbf{x}_0, \ldots  $$

be a _unsigned $w$-bit binary integer sequence_ with period $P$, 
where $w$ is the word size of the intended machine. Let $\textrm{trunc}_v(\mathbf{x}_i)$ 
denote the number formed by the $v$ most significant bits of $\mathbf{x}_i$. Consider the $kv$-bit vectors for the entire period:

$$ (\textrm{trunc}_v(\mathbf{x}_i), \textrm{trunc}_v(\mathbf{x}_{i+1}), \ldots, \textrm{trunc}_v(\mathbf{x}_{i+k-1})), \qquad i = 0, \ldots, P-1 .$$

A pseudorandom sequence $\mathbf{x}_i$ of $w$-bit integers of period $P$ is said to be _$k$-dimensionally equidistributed with $v$-bit accuracy_ if each of the $2^{kv}$ possible combinations of bits occurs the same number of times over the whole period $P$, except for the all-zero combination that occurs once less often. 

The largest value of $k$ with this property is called the _dimension of equidistribution 
with $v$-bit accuracy_, denoted by $k(v)$.

This definition is based on the assumption that the higher digits are large numbers. In particular, the dimension of equidistribution assures that the output values with the $v$ most significant bits are uniformly distributed up to dimension $k(v)$. Thus, as a criterion of uniformity, larger values of $k(v)$ for each $1\leq v \leq w$ is desirable.

Now we have a trivial upper bound 

$$ k(v) \leq \lfloor \log_2 (P+1) /v \rfloor $$

for each $v = 1,2,\ldots,w$. Define the sum of the gaps 

$$ \Delta := \sum_{v = 1}^{w} (\lfloor \log_2 (P+1)/v \rfloor - k(v)). $$

If $\Delta = 0$, the generator is said to be _maximally equidistributed (ME)_.  

The aim of our study is to design maximally equidistributed $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear PRNGs with similar speed as 64-bit Mersenne Twisters.

## Performance

We compare the following MT-type PRNGs corresponding to $64$-bit output sequences:
- MELG19937-64: the 64-bit integer output of our proposed generator;
- MT19937-64: the 64-bit integer output of the 64-bit Mersenne Twister (downloaded from
http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/âˆ¼m-mat/MT/emt64.html);
- MT19937-64 (ID3): the 64-bit integer output of a 64-bit Mersenne Twister based on a five-term
recursion (ID3) (Nishimura 2000);
- SFMT19937-64 (without SIMD): the 64-bit integer output of the SIMD-oriented Fast
Mersenne Twister SFMT19937 without SIMD (Saito and Matsumoto 2008);
- SFMT19937-64 (with SIMD): the 64-bit integer output of the foregoing with SIMD (Saito
and Matsumoto 2008).

We measure the CPU time (in seconds) taken to generate $10^9$ 64-bit unsigned integers. 
The following table summarizes the timing and the figures of merit $\Delta$ and $N_1$. 
See the remark below for the definition of $N_1$.

| Generators | CPU time (Intel) | CPU time (AMD) | $\Delta$ | $N_1$ |
| :--------- | ---------------: | -------------: | -------: | ----: |
| **MELG19937-64** | **4.2123** | **6.2920** | **0** | **9603** |
| MT19937-64 | 5.1002 | 6.6490 | 7820 | 285 |
| MT19937-64 (ID3) | 4.8993 | 6.7930 | 7940 | 5795 |
| SFMT19937-64 (without SIMD) | 4.2654 | 5.6123 | **14095** | 6711 |
| SFMT19937-64 (with SIMD) | 1.8457 | 2.8806 | **14095** | 6711 |

Platforms (64-bit CPUs and OSs):

- CPU time (Intel): Intel Core i7-3770 (3.40GHz) Linux gcc compiler with -O3
- CPU time (AMD): AMD Phenom II X6 1045T (2.70 GHz) Linux gcc compiler with -O3

**SFMT19937 is very fast but $\Delta$ for SFMT19937 is large.** 
(In fact, the SFMT
generators are optimized under the assumption that one will mainly be using 32-bit output sequences. For double-precision floating-point numbers, **dSFMT** is faster than SFMT and is also improved
from the viewpoint of the dimensions of equidistribution with $v$-bit accuracy.)

Remark:
>For MT-type PRNGs, each bit of the sequence obeys a linear feedback shift register generator with the characteristic polynomial $P(x)$ over the two-element field $\mathbb{F}_2$.
Let $N_1$ be the number of nonzero coefficients of $P(x)$. 
In addition to the excellent equidistribution, as a secondary criterion, $N_1$ should be large enough. 
This criterion implies that the PRNG avoids a long-lasting impact for poor initialization, such as 0-excess states (Panneton et al, 2006).
